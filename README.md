## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up your environment variables:**

   - Copy `example.env.json` to `env.json`:

     ```
     cp example.env.json env.json
     ```

   - Open `env.json` in your editor and add your API keys for your chosen AI provider(s).

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The app will use the API keys you provided in `env.json` to connect to your AI provider (for example, [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) or [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)), depending on which backend you plan to use.

That's it! Driver AI should now be running.
